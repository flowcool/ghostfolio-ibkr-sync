## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Historical dividend comparison

Every truthy DRY_RUN SHALL compare cash distributions with existing target-account dividend sets, before deduplication hides them. Cash establishes gross/withholding; current exact accrual association establishes quantity. Missing/conflicting evidence SHALL remain uncertain. Comparisons SHALL use common currency units and exact decimal values and never sum component quantities.

The diagnostic SHALL retain original JSON decimal numeric evidence from the existing GET before float decoding; reconstructing evidence from decoded floats SHALL NOT establish exactness. The existing import/position numeric path, read count and failure contract SHALL remain unchanged. The `dividend_dates` index SHALL change: it SHALL exclude rows whose comment starts with `dividend#`, and each entry SHALL carry date, exact gross, currency and fee instead of a bare date. Destination gross SHALL be exact stored quantity × unitPrice, summed only within a complete representation; fees SHALL use the same representation. Source gross SHALL remain exact cash payments; source fee SHALL use the existing max(0,-cash withholding) convention. Raw signed withholding/refund rows and their total SHALL remain separate evidence. Gross/fee deltas SHALL be destination minus source after normalization; a gross or fee delta whose absolute value is below half a minor unit of the source currency SHALL be classified rounding noise and SHALL stay counted in the summary and visible at DEBUG; every other nonzero delta, and every quantity delta, SHALL remain visible without tolerance or display rounding suppression. Below-half-unit display noise SHALL NOT prove a cause or suppress a source-proven replacement from the separate correction review.

A nonempty activity currency SHALL determine the denomination of its price and fee. Only null activity currency SHALL permit fallback to a supported profile currency, with explicit provenance. Missing/invalid/unsupported context SHALL remain uncertain. Major/minor units SHALL be normalized exactly without overwriting activity denomination; a GBP activity with a GBp profile SHALL NOT be rescaled as though its activity values were GBp.

The report SHALL distinguish coherent single/component sets, probable repeated representations, quantity/monetary differences, absent destination records, uncertain identity and outside-report-window history. Findings can overlap. Canonical account/comment identity SHALL require consistent security/date evidence; proximity, legacy-symbol or timezone explanations alone SHALL remain uncertain. Inactive/unsupported records SHALL NOT certify matches. Every source group and unmatched target dividend SHALL be accounted for; no finding authorizes repair.

A complete representation SHALL cover one whole source payment group as a single activity or cover every independently identified source component exactly once as a component set. Only identity/coverage-proven partitions SHALL be evaluated; amount equality SHALL NOT establish completeness and arbitrary subset search SHALL NOT be used. A complete representation with quantity/gross/fee disagreement SHALL retain its discrepancies; coherent SHALL require exact agreement on all supported quantities, gross and fee. Two or more distinct complete representations of the same source group SHALL be probable repetition even with discrepancies; incomplete or unproven partitions SHALL remain uncertain. Assignment SHALL be globally unique across source groups: no destination activity SHALL certify two groups. Contested ownership SHALL leave all affected comparisons uncertain, independent of processing order.

#### Scenario: Payment representations
- **WHEN** synthetic inputs cover ordinary/bonus, split PIL, whole-payment versus component sets, repeated sets with monetary discrepancies, incomplete partitions, disputed cross-group ownership, fractional quantities, sub-float decimal differences, signed tax/refunds, null activity currency, GBP/GBp denomination differences and unsupported currency context
- **THEN** components remain distinct from repetition; complete-but-discrepant representations are not coherent; disputed ownership stays uncertain in either processing order; currency provenance, quantity differences, signed exact monetary deltas and raw tax/refund evidence are reported independently.

Check: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py -k representations`.

#### Scenario: Incomplete identity
- **WHEN** fixtures include missing/conflicting accruals, absent destination rows, legacy comments, timezone shifts, inactive rows and older history
- **THEN** coverage and uncertainty are explicit; no weak match is certified.

Check: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py -k evidence`.

#### Scenario: Legacy comment identity
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py -k coherent_dividend_legacy_identity` runs canonical and legacy symbol comments with passing and failing identity checks
- **THEN** a legacy comment whose account, comment symbol and comment date qualify owns one source block; a later failed destination-row check stays in that block with the check named; no row is reported twice.

#### Scenario: Currency states and declared rate
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py -k 'coherent_dividend_currency or coherent_dividend_declared_rate'` runs KRW, JPY, missing, conflicting and unknown currency cases plus one-action, multi-action and missing-rate evidence
- **THEN** KRW and JPY compare with one-unit precision; each invalid state has the correct reason; only the one-action matched-Re rate is retained.


### Requirement: Readable dividend report

Each finding SHALL use English plain words, one `Action:` line and the statement that nothing was written. A block SHALL NOT include a second `Proposed action:` line. No report block or summary line SHALL contain a Python representation, including `Decimal(...)`, dict/list syntax, exponent notation or the word `None` as a value. Missing values SHALL read `unavailable`. Category, failed-check and unavailable-check summaries SHALL use deterministic plain `name:count` text, or `none` when empty.

Every monetary value shown in a block, including gross, fee and monetary deltas on both the source and destination sides, SHALL be quantized for display to the common currency minor unit with round-half-away-from-zero. Quantities SHALL retain their exact plain-decimal display. Display rounding SHALL NOT change comparison, category or action.

The classes SHALL remain coherent, information, noise, outside window and to check. `unsupported currency` SHALL appear only when a nonempty code has no explicit minor-unit definition. Missing currency SHALL read `missing currency`; unequal supported codes SHALL read `conflicting currencies`. A source and destination that both use KRW SHALL be comparable, not unsupported.

A complete single legacy activity with equal quantity and fee SHALL be `legacy declared-rate rounding` information when its Ghostfolio gross equals quantity × the matched payment `Re` `grossRate` and the paid cash gross differs by exactly one minor unit. Its reason SHALL state that the legacy row uses the declared rate and IBKR paid a rounded cash amount. Its sole action SHALL read `No action: IBKR rounding accepted.` The block SHALL stay visible at INFO as audit information. It SHALL NOT suggest that IBKR revised the amount after import. A one-minor-unit fee or gross difference outside this proven pattern SHALL remain `minimal difference, cause unknown` only when the source cannot prove the exact replacement. An exact source replacement without a named cause SHALL use label `source-proven correction` and retain the existing profile or manual yes route. The diagnostic formatter SHALL remain read-only. The registry SHALL add no correction gate. An informational cause SHALL prevent correction only for its proven fields where the source is not more exact; independent fields retain their existing correction checks. A preview SHALL state would correct, never corrected; a live result SHALL state corrected only after exact readback. Missing exact replacement proof SHALL remain to_check without a write. Profile deferral, manual approval needed and unresolved journals SHALL retain distinct outcomes.

After informational findings, one INFO line SHALL read `N to check, N informational, N noise`, followed by each item to check at WARNING or above. Findings SHALL NOT change exits. Items to check SHALL join the required-action notification. Information and noise alone SHALL not trigger it. Named diagnostic evidence limitations
SHALL be informational and SHALL state that no correction is requested. Explicit
outside-window findings SHALL retain debug visibility without a correction request.

#### Scenario: Plain, quantized, single-action report
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py tests/test_check_dividend_report.py -k 'coherent_dividend_format or check_dividend_report'` formats decimals, unavailable values, empty/nonempty summaries and blocks with match proposals
- **THEN** monetary text uses the currency minor unit; quantities stay exact; each block has one action; the checker reports zero violations.

#### Scenario: Classes from synthetic inputs
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py -k 'dividend_readable_classes or dividend_readable_pairs or coherent_dividend_one_jpy'` runs noise, one-unit, larger, quantity, legacy, split, absent and unsupported cases
- **THEN** existing classes stay stable except the complete declared-rate one-unit pattern and named diagnostic evidence limitations. These become information with their known reasons and no-action results.

#### Scenario: Plain report
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py tests/test_check_dividend_report.py -k 'dividend_readable_report or coherent_dividend_format or coherent_dividend_action'` formats source, destination, identity, summary and match text
- **THEN** all values are plain, monetary values are quantized, missing values read `unavailable`, and each block has one action.

#### Scenario: Correct currency reasons
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py -k coherent_dividend_currency` formats equal KRW, missing currency, conflicting supported codes and an unknown code
- **THEN** only the unknown code reads `unsupported currency`; equal KRW compares; the other states use their distinct reasons.

#### Scenario: One-JPY legacy row
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py -k coherent_dividend_one_jpy` runs equal quantity and fee, Ghostfolio gross equal to quantity × `grossRate`, paid cash gross one JPY higher or lower, and one-JPY fee or incomplete-pattern boundaries
- **THEN** the proven gross pattern gives one visible information block with the declared-rate rounding reason and `No action: IBKR rounding accepted.`; one-unit fee differences and other cases that fail one condition do not qualify as information; exact source replacements retain their existing correction route, while missing replacement proof remains to check as `minimal difference, cause unknown`.

#### Scenario: Real read-only acceptance
- **WHEN** the operator-authorized real dry-run log is passed to `python3 scripts/check_dividend_report.py <private-log>` and every emitted dividend block is then read
- **THEN** the checker exits 0 with zero violations, and the closing evidence reports the reading verdict for every block without exposing private amounts or identifiers.

Baseline: `scripts/check_dividend_report.py` currently detects Python representations, float noise, contradictory actions, duplicate rows and false unsupported-currency reasons in the saved 2026-10-15 report.

#### Scenario: Required-action reporting compatibility
- **WHEN** `python -m pytest -q tests -k operator_action` exercises this requirement with synthetic inputs and mocked HTTP
- **THEN** required actions emit at least WARNING and join one configured notification; financial selection, payloads, account fences and exit codes remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: Cause action and observed outcome agree

- **WHEN** `python -m pytest -q tests/test_dividend_diagnostics.py -k amount_cause_report` runs information, unnamed source-proven replacements, qualified would-correct, confirmed correction, profile-off/manual yes, blocked, mixed fields and missing-proof cases
- **THEN** each block shows one consistent action; information requests no correction for its proven fields; source-proven correction needs no named cause; previews, deferrals and confirmed outcomes stay distinct; no report path adds a financial request.
