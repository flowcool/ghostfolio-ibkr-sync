## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Actionable historical dividend evidence

The source `YYYYMMDD` SHALL remain the IBKR business day. Historical identity SHALL compare it with the destination instant's calendar day in `TZ`. An absent destination profile ISIN SHALL be unavailable evidence and SHALL NOT block amount comparison; a nonempty conflict SHALL fail identity.

Dry-run details SHALL name each failed or unavailable active/id/data-source/symbol/date/ISIN check with expected/observed values. Human blocks SHALL show security, source and destination UTC/local dates, activity IDs, and supported quantity/gross/fee/currency. INFO SHALL count failed checks. Canonically absent sources skipped by import deduplication SHALL remain absent and SHALL name the skip path that import selection takes, with the same predicate and input set (connector-comment rows excluded), in its order: `skipped by historical comment` when the account's old `dividend#<symbol>#<date>` comment is among the existing dividend comments of any activity, active or not; otherwise `skipped by proximity`. Each SHALL show the available weak-candidate values and active status; `skipped by proximity` SHALL also show source and candidate gross. Neither label SHALL certify identity. A finding left uncertain by missing, unsupported or conflicting currency context SHALL keep its reason and SHALL show the observed source and destination currency values and provenance. Outside-window rows SHALL show destination security, date, and values. No finding SHALL repair data or change selection.

Baseline: the v2.5.0 dry run emitted 114 opaque findings. Saved evidence measured missing profile ISIN in 44/44 groups, Paris-midnight dates in 5/44, and no other failed identity checks. The first replay of this change passed identity for 44/44 and compared 39: three unproven component partitions, two unsupported-currency (KRW) groups, and two absent groups skipped by old symbol comments but labeled proximity.

#### Scenario: Separate identity checks and local dates
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests -k 'historical_diagnostic_identity'` exercises all six checks, Paris winter/summer dates, absent ISIN, and conflicting ISIN
- **THEN** each check exposes expected/observed values, local calendar matches certify date, missing ISIN permits amount comparison, and conflicting ISIN blocks it.

#### Scenario: Actionable private report
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests -k 'historical_diagnostic_actionable'` exercises outside-window rows and proximity skips
- **THEN** private human-readable details and aggregate counts expose the required evidence without certifying weak identity or changing data.

#### Scenario: Skip cause and observed currency
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests -k 'historical_diagnostic_skip_cause'` exercises an absent group with an old symbol comment and a proximity candidate, the same with an inactive comment carrier, an absent group with only a proximity candidate, an absent group whose only nearby row is canonical, and unsupported, missing and conflicting source/destination currency context
- **THEN** the first two show `skipped by historical comment`, the third `skipped by proximity` with both gross values, an absent group whose only nearby row has a connector comment is not proximity-skipped, each finding stays absent or uncertain, currency findings keep their reason and show observed source/destination currency and provenance, and import selection is unchanged.

#### Scenario: Legacy identity and residual skip causes
- **WHEN** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -v tests -k 'coherent_dividend_legacy_identity or historical_diagnostic_skip_cause'` exercises a valid old symbol comment, an old comment with a failed identity check, and sources with only non-identity historical or proximity candidates
- **THEN** each row claimed by its old symbol comment appears in one source block even when a destination-row check fails; only comments that fail the account-and-comment claim criteria use residual skip-cause wording; import selection is unchanged.

#### Scenario: Real read-only acceptance
- **WHEN** the operator-authorized `DRY_RUN=1 LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG .venv/bin/python -m ghostfolio_ibkr_sync` runs with the approved real-data ENV and private log capture
- **THEN** zero financial writes occur; all 44 previously blocked groups pass the active, id, data-source, symbol and local-date checks, with ISIN pass or unavailable; each reaches exact amount comparison or stays uncertain only with `component partition identity not proven` or a currency-context finding that shows the observed currency, never a component assignment inferred from amounts; the outcome matches the replay baseline of 39 compared, 3 unproven partitions and 2 unsupported currency, and any other cause or count fails acceptance and is reported; every remaining anomaly is explainable from the log; both absent groups log `skipped by historical comment`, reconciled with their evidence rows; and both unsupported-currency groups show a `currency context:` line naming KRW.
